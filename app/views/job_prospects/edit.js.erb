$('form.new_job_prospect').replaceWith("<%= j render(:partial=> 'form', :locals =>{:job_prospect=> @job_prospect})%>")
$('.form').show();
$('.new_job_prospect_button').hide();

// instead of this could always do everything clientside where you would keep the same form 
// no hiding or showing that would just use js to rerender the action
// this would allow the form to be created purely server side
// The third option would be to creat two separate forms for edit and new and toggle the two forms.
